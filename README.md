# Shooting-Game
Portfolio project made by me during "Hacking With Swift" iOS App development course.

This is a simple game for iPhone where the player needs to shoot as many green targets as possible to get the highest score.

The game is very simple, to made it I used SpriteKit library, SFX, and image assets.
